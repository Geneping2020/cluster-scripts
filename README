#####
SETUP
#####

To use these scripts, copy them to the cluster file system and make sure their location is in your PATH.

Running the following commands from your home directory on the cluster will:

-- create a folder called bin in your home directory:
mkdir ~/bin

-- copy the scripts across:
cp /afs/inf.ed.ac.uk/group/project/datacdt/s1126151-GridEngineScripts/{qcat,qhead,get-output-file,qtail,show-past-jobs} ~/bin

-- make sure they are executable:
chmod u+x {qcat,qhead,get-output-file,qtail,show-past-jobs}

-- add the bin folder to your PATH:
echo "export PATH=/home/$USER/bin:\$PATH" >> ~/.benv

-- Update the current PATH:
source ~/.benv

You should now be able to run the scripts from anywhere when on the cluster.

All the scripts should explain usage when run with `help' as the argument; for example:
qcat help

The colurs used in the show-past-job script can be changed -- the comments in the script explain how to do so.
